## The Bug

The bug was that 'GET' request returns empty array of objects like `[{}, {}, {}]` even the `POST` request returned `OK`

However the data is actually stored on the db successfully

The problem was that the struct members are 'lower-cased' which can't be used in the API response.
I've solved it by capitalizing the first Letter of each member

```go
type row struct {
 ID        int64     `json:"id"`
 CreatedAt time.Time `json:"created_at"`
}
```

And It worked ðŸŽ‰

Another issue I've encountered was issue when trying to run `docker compose` that the server is started before the db was actually ready,
one of the solutions I've though of was

1. add a timeout to wait for the connection to be ready, although it didn't work very well ðŸ˜¥
2. to use `wait-for` script, to ensure that the web server won't start unless the db is fully ready! and it did work ðŸŽ‰
